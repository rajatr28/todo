# TODO App built with ReactJS and NodeJS

### The source code for the project is organized into two directories
   * frontend
   * backend
   
#### Note: Make sure you're running v8.x of Nodejs for ReactJS

   To start the local development server, cd into either of the two directories and run
   ```
   npm install
   npm start
   ```
   This will launch the respective local development server on your machine.
